need input file icoordinput
example included
should run fine besides that and will produce files to be read by python script
the icoordinput file is the same as used for all 
will split up your CONFIG or REVCON into boxes of length you define angstromgs and calculate a density for the box
outputs values of density in the x-y plane with each slice in z
Define box length in the input file icoordinput (the last entry in the exmaple this case being 20.0 is the lenght of the box)
